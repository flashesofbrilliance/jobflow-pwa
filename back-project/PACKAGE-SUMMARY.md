## üéØ Key Innovation Summary

### 1. Frame Storming Engine
**Revolutionary insight:** Help users examine their career framing before discovery begins. Most decisions fail due to pursuing wrong goals efficiently.

### 2. Brutal Honesty Engine  
**Market differentiation:** First platform willing to say "You won't get this role because..." with evidence. Eliminates false hope and wasted applications.

### 3. Enhanced Haystack Algorithm v2.0
**Technical innovation:** Multi-dimensional scoring with adaptive learning:
- Base Score (35%): Skills/experience match
- Culture Score (25%): Work style compatibility  
- Timing Score (20%): Chronos/Kairos analysis
- Alumni Score (15%): Team archetype similarity
- Work Style Score (5%): Communication preferences

### 4. Shadow Work Integration
**Psychological depth:** Address the seven career demons that sabotage success:
- Ego, Hubris, Greed, Fear, Comparison, Perfectionism, Identity

### 5. Anti-ATS Positioning
**Marketing hook:** "98% of ATS systems reject qualified candidates. Get your own algorithm that works FOR you, not against you."

## üöÄ Implementation Priority

### Phase 0: Foundation (Weeks 1-3)
- Infrastructure setup + Frame Storming Engine

### Phase 1: Core Intelligence (Weeks 4-8)
