# Project Overview: JobFlow/Satori

## Core Mission
**"Eliminate wasted time in job searching through evidence-based pattern recognition and contemplative decision-making."**

## The Problem We're Solving

### Industry Pain Points
- **98% ATS rejection rate** due to keyword mismatches, not lack of qualifications
- **10+ hours per week** wasted on mismatched applications
- **45% False Positive Error Rate** - nearly half of applications go nowhere
- **No feedback loop** - people repeat the same mistakes without learning
- **Cultural mismatches** cause 70% of job dissatisfaction within 6 months
- **Decision anxiety** from information overload without wisdom

### The Root Cause
Traditional job searching optimizes for:
- **Volume over quality** (spray and pray)
- **Company needs over candidate fit** (ATS systems)
- **Surface matching over deep compatibility** (keyword matching)
- **Speed over wisdom** (apply quickly without reflection)

## Our Solution: The World's First Candidate Tracking System (CTS)

### Core Innovation
Instead of hoping company ATS systems pick you, you get your own algorithm that picks opportunities for you.

### Key Components

#### 1. Frame Storming Engine
**Problem:** Users think they know what they want, but they're operating from distorted frames
**Solution:** Metacognitive questioning to clarify actual needs before search begins
**Example:** "I want VP at prestigious company" → "I want autonomy and impact in climate tech"

#### 2. Enhanced Haystack Algorithm v2.0
**Multi-dimensional scoring:**
- Base Score (35%): Skills/experience match
- Culture Score (25%): Work style compatibility
- Timing Score (20%): Chronos/Kairos analysis
- Alumni Score (15%): Team archetype similarity
- Work Style Score (5%): Communication preferences

#### 3. Brutal Honesty Engine
**Reality-based assessments:**
- "You won't get this role because you need Fortune 500 + MBB background (evidence: 97% of hires)"
- "This culture will drain you - 23% compatibility with your work style"
- "Apply NOW - funding just closed, hiring window open for 60 days"

#### 4. Shadow Work Integration
**The Seven Career Demons:**
- Ego: Attachment to titles/prestige
- Hubris: Overconfidence in abilities
- Greed: Money over alignment
- Fear: Risk aversion preventing growth
- Comparison: Measuring against others
- Perfectionism: Analysis paralysis
- Identity: Rigid self-concepts

#### 5. Work Style Compatibility Matrix
**4-Dimensional Analysis:**
- Communication: Formal ↔ Informal
- Pace: Chill ↔ Intense
- Feedback: Kind ↔ Blunt
- Collaboration: Independent ↔ Collaborative

#### 6. Contemplative Decision Making
**Digital third space for career wisdom:**
- Time-boxed reflection prompts
- Perspective evolution tracking
- Decision frameworks (Heart/Head/Wallet)
- Contemplative calendar practice

## Implementation Philosophy

### Build Principles
1. **User time is sacred** - every feature must save more time than it costs
2. **Brutal honesty with compassion** - truth delivered with wisdom
3. **Evidence over opinion** - all recommendations backed by data
4. **Contemplative technology** - slow wisdom in a fast world
5. **Privacy-first architecture** - users own their career data

### Development Approach
- Start with highest-impact features (Frame Storming + Brutal Honesty)
- Build feedback loops from day one
- Progressive disclosure of complexity
- Mobile-first, offline-capable design
- Modular architecture for rapid iteration

This overview provides the strategic context for all technical implementation decisions. Every feature should ladder up to the core mission of eliminating wasted time through better career decision-making.
