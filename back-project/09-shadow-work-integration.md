# Shadow Work Integration: The Seven Demons

## Framework
Recognize, surface, and soften the impact of hidden psychological forces that distort career decisions.

## The Seven Demons and Detection
- **Ego**: Title/prestige obsessions
- **Hubris**: Overconfidence in “fixer” roles
- **Greed**: Money over fit
- **Fear**: Safety-seeking, risk avoidance
- **Comparison**: Peer benchmark fixation
- **Perfectionism**: Analysis paralysis
- **Identity**: Over-attachment to old labels

## Integration Points
- Demons detected from search and application patterns
- Personalized tips and reframing suggestions in the UI
- Reflection prompts tied to demons showing up in behavior

## Engine Design
- Onboarding checks for tendencies
- Real-time detection (e.g., “You skipped 4 roles for title, ego demon alert”)
- User-configurable intervention intensity (gentle → blunt)
- Engagement tracked for shadow work summary and growth over time
