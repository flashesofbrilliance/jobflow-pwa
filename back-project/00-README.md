## 🎯 Core Value Proposition

**Problem:** 98% of ATS systems reject qualified candidates. Job seekers waste 10+ hours per week on mismatched applications.

**Solution:** JobFlow gives candidates their own algorithm - a Candidate Tracking System (CTS) that finds where they belong instead of hoping company ATS systems pick them.

**Differentiation:** 
- First career platform with brutal honesty engine
- Integrates shadow work and contemplative decision-making
- Frame storming to clarify what users actually want
- Multi-dimensional fit scoring with adaptive learning
- Energy protection through work style compatibility

## 🚀 Quick Start for Developers

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.9+
- PostgreSQL 15+
- Redis 6+
- Docker & Docker Compose

### Development Setup (5 minutes)
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repository>
cd jobflow
cp .env.example .env

# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# Install dependencies
npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Initialize database
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed

# Start development servers
npm run dev:frontend  # React PWA on :3000
npm run dev:backend   # FastAPI on :8000
```

### Key Features to Implement First
1. **Frame Storming Engine** - Help users clarify what they actually want
2. **Enhanced Haystack Algorithm** - Multi-dimensional fit scoring
3. **Brutal Honesty Engine** - Reality-based opportunity assessment
4. **Work Style Compatibility** - 4D culture fit analysis
5. **Shadow Work Integration** - Bias detection and correction

## 📊 Success Metrics
- Reduce False Positive Error Rate from 45% to <20%
- Time to first interview: 50% improvement
- User energy during search: >7/10 (vs industry avg 4/10)
- Long-term job satisfaction: >85% at 6 months

## 🎭 Unique Innovation Points

### 1. Frame Storming (Metacognitive Layer)
Before helping users find opportunities, help them examine how they're framing their search. Most career decisions fail due to pursuing the wrong goals efficiently.

### 2. Brutal Honesty Engine
First platform willing to tell users uncomfortable truths: "You won't get this role because you need Fortune 500 + MBD background (97% of their hires match this pattern)."

### 3. Shadow Work Integration  
Address the seven demons that sabotage career success: Ego, Hubris, Greed, Fear, Comparison, Perfectionism, Identity attachment.

### 4. Contemplative Technology
Create digital third spaces for career wisdom to emerge through structured reflection, not just optimization for speed.

### 5. Anti-ATS Positioning
Position as the rebellion against Applicant Tracking Systems. JobFlow is the first Candidate Tracking System that works FOR professionals, not against them.

## 📞 Support & Documentation

Each markdown file in this package contains detailed implementation instructions, code examples, and architectural decisions. The documentation is written for senior developers who can take these specifications and build a production-ready application.

For questions about implementation details, refer to the specific markdown files. The architecture is designed to be modular - each component can be built and tested independently.

## 🎪 The Vision

JobFlow/Satori isn't just a job search tool - it's a hyperstructure for human flourishing. In a post-capitalist world where AI handles commodity work, this platform helps humans discover their unique contribution through evidence-based self-discovery and contemplative decision-making.

**The ultimate goal:** Never waste a decade on the wrong path.
